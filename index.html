<p>Prior to the 2013-2014 NBA season, SportVu tracking cameras were installed in all 30 NBA arenas. These six cameras would use cutting edge technology to track the exact location of all players, ref and the ball 25 times a second. This tracking data could later be used by teams, the league and privately run companies to provide new insights and analysis about the game of basketball.</p>

<p>Although most of this data is heavily guarded, a small portion is available publicly on NBA.com. It is our hope to use this data, combining it with the previously available play-by-play and shot chart data, to create a model that will give us the probability that a given shot will go in. With this model we will explore many insights that could prove valuable to fans and teams alike.</p>

<p>Some prior work in this area has been done, and it was these projects which partially inspired us to do this. These projects are, in no particular order:</p>

<ul>

<a id="objectives" class="anchor" href="#objectives" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Objectives</h3>

<ol>
<li>Create a model that will give us a probability of each shot going in. The three main techniques we will pursue are: 

<ul>
<li>Logistic Regression with l1 (Lasso) Regularization</li>
<li>Logistic Regression with l2 (Ridge) Regularization</li>
<li>Random Forest</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Explore how shot difficulty and shooting percentage above expected vary with quarter and time left in the game</li>
<li>Explore how shot difficulty and shooting percentage above expected vary with score differential.</li>
<li>Quantify which players take the highest percentage shots and which players score the most above their projected output.</li>
<li>Quantify which players increase their teammates' expected points per shot the most.</li>
</ol>

<a id="data" class="anchor" href="#data" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Data</h3>

<p>The first type of data that we want to get is the SportVu tracking data for all shots. These shots are sorted by player and are located on the <a href="http://stats.nba.com/player/#!/201939/tracking/shotslogs/">'Shot Log' page of their player profile</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hwchase17/sportvu/gh-pages/pictures/shotlogdata.png" alt="Shot Log Data"></p>

<p>The next type of data that we need is the data from the NBA.com shot charts. This provides us with new information like the type of shot, general area (Right, Left, Middle) of each shot, and x,y coordinates.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hwchase17/sportvu/gh-pages/pictures/shotchartdata.png" alt="Shot Chart Data"></p>

<p>Finally, we have out last set of data, play by play for each game. This dataset will provide us with other key pieces of information we need for our insights that we don't already have, like score differential at time of shot, whether the action before was a turnover (to identify fast break opportunities) and the ids of the players who are on the court.</p>

<h3>
<a id="analysis" class="anchor" href="#analysis" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Analysis</h3>

<p>Two different components go into all points scored. First is the expected points per shot, and then there points scored above/below average. For example, if our model says Steph Curry has a 40% chance of scoring a given three pointer, then his expected points on that shot is 1.2. If he makes the shot then his points above expected on that shot is 1.8, if he misses it then it is -1.2. We can average these components for all of a player's shots to get there average expected points and average points above expectation. We found those components for all players, and then plotted them on a graph. Going clockwise, the upper right quadrant is players who take easy shots and make them at a higher than expected rate, the bottom right is players that take hard shots and make them at a higher than expected rate, the bottom left is players who take tough shots and don't make them a lot, and then the upper left is players who take easy shots and don't make them a lot.</p>

<p>Of course, a player's expected points per shot is in turn affected by multiple things. There is the ability of the player himself to get good looks, there is the ability of his teammates to get him good looks, and then there is the ability of the defense to stop him from getting good looks. Running a massive ridge regression with the expected points for a shot as the dependent variable and then dummy variables for who is on the court (three possible types: one for the shooter, one for each player on offense but not shooting, and then one for each player on defense), we can get three coefficients for each player: their ability to get good shoots, their ability to help their teammates get good shots, and their ability to prevent opponents from getting good shots. Below we have plotted scatterplots reflecting a few of those stats.</p>

<p>Ability to get good shots vs. Ability to get teammates good shots</p>

<p>Ability to get teammates good shots vs. Points Above Expected </p>

<p>Ability to get teammates good shots vs. Ability to prevent opponents from getting good shots</p>
